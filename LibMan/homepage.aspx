           Online Library Management system aims to make over the existing inconvenient registry style management of the books and users of the library. Our goal is to shift from this traditional approach to a more efficient and flexible system of storing and retrieving information in the database by developing a website. This model will iron out the problems previously faced by facilitating the user and the admin/librarian to sign into their respective profiles and enabling them with transaction such as registering, adding, searching, deleting the books or users. The library management system stores the important points, such as the name, address, identification number, date of birth of users who arrive in the library. Important book details such as book name, book number, price, author, edition, year of publication, etc., will also be stored. The application focuses primarily on the basic operations such as adding new members, new books, updating new information, searching for books  and returning of books.
